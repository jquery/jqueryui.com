	"title": "About jQuery UI"
}</script>

<p>jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library. Whether you're building highly interactive web applications or you just need to add a date picker to a form control, jQuery UI is the perfect choice.</p>

<p>There's a lot of work that goes into making jQuery UI the most succesful UI library for the Web. Between API design, visual design, implementation, ticket triage, bug fixing, developer relations, infrastructure, and everything else, most of the work is done by volunteers. We'd like to recognize the most prominent contributors below, for a full list of all contributors, see the <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt">authors list</a>.</p>
