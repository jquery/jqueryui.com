}</script>

## Overview

This guide will assist in upgrading from jQuery UI 1.10.x to jQuery UI 1.11.x.
All changes are listed below, organized by plugin, along with how to upgrade
your code to work with jQuery UI 1.11.

## General changes

We made some changes that affect all source files and the ways you can access and load them in your applications. Our goal was to simplify where possible, while supporting more environments, specifically AMD and bower.

### Renamed files

We've dropped "jquery.ui." prefix from all source files, so for example "jquery.ui.accordion.js" is now "accordion.js". This makes usage with AMD easier (see below) and makes it generally easier to deal with the individual source files.

### AMD support

jQuery UI now supports AMD out-of-the-box. That means that you can specify "ui/autocomplete" as a dependency in your module, and an AMD capable loader will resolve all the dependencies that "autocomplete" has. You can learn more about using jQuery UI with AMD on [learn.jquery.com](http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/environments/amd/).

### Bower support

jQuery UI now supports bower out-of-the-box. That means that you can install jQuery UI with bower by running `bower install jquery-ui`. You can learn more about using jQuery UI with bower on [learn.jquery.com](http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/environments/bower/).

### Simplified custom and quick downloads

We've simplified our download packages. Instead of including all demos and source files, we now only include the concatenated files. The new structure looks like this:

<pre>
.
├── images
│   └── ...
├── index.html
├── jquery-ui.css
├── jquery-ui.js
├── jquery-ui.min.css
├── jquery-ui.min.js
├── jquery-ui.structure.css
├── jquery-ui.structure.min.css
├── jquery-ui.theme.css
├── jquery-ui.theme.min.css
└── jquery.js
</pre>

The `jquery-ui.structure.css` file provides the structural CSS rules (such as margins and positioning), and the `jquery-ui.theme.css` file contains the theming rules (such as backgrounds, colors, and fonts). This setup allows you to easily change themes by swapping in new `jquery-ui.theme.css` files. You can also build a theme from scratch by building on top of `jquery-ui.structure.css`.

If you want the complete jQuery UI source files, demos, and tests, you can get them from <https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/releases>.

### Discontinued IE7 Support

As of this release we are no longer accepting bug reports for IE7 issues. We have also removed IE7 from our testing infrastructure. The IE7 workarounds are still present in the code, but we will remove them for jQuery UI 1.12.



## Core

### Deprecate .focus( n )

[todo]

### Deprecated .zIndex()

[todo]

### Removed $.ui.hasScroll()

[(#9190)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9190) The deprecated and undocumented `$.ui.hasScroll()` method has been removed as it was only used by the resizable interaction.

### Removed $.ui.keyCode.NUMPAD_*.

[(#9269)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9269) The following key code constants have been removed as they were not used by jQuery UI:

* `$.ui.keyCode.NUMPAD_ADD`
* `$.ui.keyCode.NUMPAD_DECIMAL`
* `$.ui.keyCode.NUMPAD_DIVIDE`
* `$.ui.keyCode.NUMPAD_ENTER`
* `$.ui.keyCode.NUMPAD_MULTIPLY`
* `$.ui.keyCode.NUMPAD_SUBTRACT`



## Accordion

### Remove deprecated content property in create event

[todo]


## Dialog

### Removed deprecated position handling

[todo]

### Dialog: Switch back to shuffling z-index, but only look at .ui-front siblings.

[todo]


## Position

### Removed `offset` option; use `my` or `at`

([#6982](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6982))
The `offset` option has been removed in favor of providing offset information in
`my` or `at`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-offset-option-merged-into-my-and-at) for full details.


## Effects

### Give puff-effect and size-effect its own files. Previously, they were into scale-effect file.

[todo]

## Menu

### Add `items` option for better definition of menu items in non parent-child structures

[todo]

### Remove the requirement to use anchors in menu items (no ticket reference in beta.2 changelog, create a retro ticket)

[todo]

### Simplify styling. Remove rounded corners, reduce spacing.

[todo]



## Slider

### Add Windows 8 touch support

[(#9709)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9709) The slider widget now supports usage on Windows 8 touch devices.

### Switch handles from anchors to spans

[(#9890)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9890) The slider widget now uses `<a>` elements instead of `<span>` elements for its handles to workaround an issue with usage in some single-page application frameworks. The handles still use the same `ui-slider-handle` class name as a styling hook.



## Spinner

### Add `isValid()` method

[(#9542)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9542) The spinner widget now exposes an `isValid()` for determining whether the value of the spinner's input is valid. For example the following returns `true`:

```
$( "<input value=1>" )
    .spinner({ step: 1 })
    .spinner( "isValid" );
```

And the following returns `false`:

```
$( "<input value=1>" )
    .spinner({ step: 2 })
    .spinner( "isValid" );
```



## Widget

### Make the _init method optional.

[(#9543)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9543)

### `$.widget()` returns the widget's constructor.

[(#9467)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9467) The `$.widget()` method now returns the widget's constructor instead of `undefined`. As an example the following code creates a dialog extension, and then uses the new widget's constructor function to create an instance on a newly created `<div>`:

```
var redDialog = $.widget( "myNamespace.redDialog", $.ui.dialog, {
    _create: function() {
        this._super();
        this.element.css( "color", "red" );
    }
});
redDialog( {}, "<div>jQuery UI Rocks!</div>" );
```

The same constructor functions are also returned when you use the jQuery UI widgets in an AMD context. For more details on how to use the widget's constructor functions, see our guide on [using jQuery UI with AMD](http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/environments/amd/).

### Implement `instance()` method on the bridge to return widget instance

[(#9030)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9030) A new `instance()` method is now available on the plugin bridge. The method provides access to the widget's instance without going through `$.data()`.

Old:

```
var instance = $( "<div>" )
    .progressbar()
    .data( "ui-progressbar" );
```

New:

```
var instance = $( "<div>" )
    .progressbar()
    .progressbar( "instance" );
```

Unlike other plugin methods, the `instance()` method is safe to call on any element. If the element is not an instance of the given widget, the method returns `undefined`. For example the following code throws an error:

```
// Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open'
$( "#not-a-dialog" ).dialog( "open" );
```

And this returns `undefined`:

```
$( "#not-a-dialog" ).dialog( "instance" );
```

### Make .enable() and .disable() act via ._setOptions() instead of ._setOption()

[todo]

### Only remove hover and focus classes when disabling, not enabling.

[todo]

### Stop setting ui-state-disabled and aria by default on setting disabled option

[todo]

### Support events with dashes and colons

[(#9708)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9708) The widget factory's `_on()` method now supports event names with dashes and colons. As an example the following creates a widget that listens for two events—one with a dash and one with a colon:

```
$.widget( "myNamespace.myWidget", {
    _create: function() {
        this._on({
            "foo-bar": function() {
                 console.log( "foo-bar" );   
            },
            "foo:bar": function() {
                console.log( "foo:bar" );
            }
        });
    }
});
```

And the following creates an instance of the above widget and triggers the two events:

```
$( "<div>" ).myWidget()
    .trigger( "foo-bar" )
    .trigger( "foo:bar" );
```
