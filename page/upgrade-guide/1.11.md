## Overview

This guide will assist in upgrading from jQuery UI 1.10.x to jQuery UI 1.11.x.
All changes are listed below, organized by plugin, along with how to upgrade
your code to work with jQuery UI 1.11.

## General changes

We made some changes that affect all source files and the ways you can access and load them in your applications. Our goal was to simplify where possible, while supporting more enviroments, specifically AMD and bower.

### Renamed files

We've dropped "jquery.ui." prefix from all source files, so for example "jquery.ui.accordion.js" is now "accordion.js". This makes usage with AMD easier (see below) and makes it generally easier to deal with the individual source files.

### AMD support

jQuery UI now supports AMD out-of-the-box. That means that you can specify "ui/autocomplete" as a dependency in your module, and an AMD capable loader will resolve all the dependencies that "autocomplete" has. You can learn more about using jQuery UI with AMD on [learn.jquery.com](http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/environments/amd/).

### Bower support

jQuery UI now supports bower out-of-the-box. That means that you can install jQuery UI with bower by running `bower install jquery-ui`. You can learn more about using jQuery UI with bower on [learn.jquery.com](http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/environments/bower/).

### Simplified custom and quick downloads

We've simplified our download packages. Instead of including all demos and source files, we now only include the concatenated files. [TODO more details on the content, especially the various CSS files]
