## Overview

This guide will assist in upgrading from jQuery UI 1.8.6 to jQuery UI 1.8.7.
All changes are listed below, organized by plugin, along with how to upgrade
your code to work with jQuery UI 1.8.7.

## Autocomplete

### `close` event occurs after menu is hidden

([#6227](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6227))
Previously the suggestions menu was hidden after the close event was triggered.
The close event is now triggered after the menu is hidden.

## Button

### Added `items` option to Buttonset widget

([#6262](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6262))
Previously all buttons, submits, resets, checkboxes, radio buttons, and anchors
contained in a buttonset were converted to buttons. Now you can control which
elements are converted by specifying an `items` option. For example, if you only
want anchors with the class `button` to be converted, you can use:

```js
$( "#buttonset" ).buttonset({
	item: "a.button"
});
```

## Datepicker

### Improved `setDate()` parameter handling

([#6684](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6684))
([#6671](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6671))
Previously if you passed a date object to the `setDate()` method, the date
object would be modified; this is no longer the case. In addition, `setDate()`
properly handles `null` and empty strings properly for clearing the date.

## Progressbar

### Added `max` option

([#6681](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6681))
You can now specify the max value for a progress bar. To do so, just set the
`max` option on init:

```js
$( "#progressbar" ).progressbar({
	max: 500
});
```
