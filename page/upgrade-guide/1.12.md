## Menu

### Menu items now require wrappers

[(#10162)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10162) To resolve [several styling issues](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10162), the menu widget now requires each menu item to be wrapped with a DOM element. The example below uses `<div>` elements for wrappers, but you can use any block-level element.

Old:

```
<ul id="menu">
	<li>One</li>
	<li>Two</li>
</ul>
```

New:

```
<ul id="menu">
	<li>
		<div>One</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>Two</div>
	</li>
</ul>
```

The autocomplete and selectmenu widgets, which both use menu internally, were both updated to include wrappers.
