}</script>

## Overview

This guide will assist in upgrading from jQuery UI 1.11.x to jQuery UI 1.12.x. All changes are listed below, organized by plugin, along with how to upgrade your code to work with jQuery UI 1.12.

## General changes

Independent of changes to specific component, this release removes support for IE7, modernizes the theming, including the default font-size, and improves support for AMD. The minimal jQuery version supported is now 1.7.x.

### Removed IE7 workarounds

[(#9838)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9838) All IE7 workarounds have been removed from the source code. If need continued IE7 support you can continue to use jQuery UI 1.11.x.

### Font size changes

[(#10131)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10131) jQuery UI themes used to be built around a `body` font-size of 62.5%, while widgets compensated for that with font-size of 1.1em. This rather small font-size default is now gone, assuming instead the default font-size of browsers.

### New default theme

[(#10617)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10617) jQuery UI used to ship with a default theme called Smoothness. This theme is still available through ThemeRoller, but has been replaced by a new default theme called Base. This new theme has been modernized to get rid of background gradients, reduce rounded corners and use some colors outside of the greyscale range. In other words, it looks much better.

### Dropped support for jQuery 1.6

[(#10723)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10723) jQuery UI no longer supports jQuery 1.6. The minimal supported version is now 1.7.0.

## Core

### Removed .focus( delay )

[(#9649)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9649) The deprecated `.focus( delay )` method override has been removed. jQuery UI was using this only in our dialog widget, where we've replaced the delayed focus call with a timeout.

### Removed .zIndex()

[(#9156)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9156) The deprecated `.zIndex()` method has been removed, in favor of the new `.ui-front` / `appendTo` logic used by all widgets that display an element on top of the page, like dialog and autocomplete.

This method was used by dialog, but because the dialog now has an [`appendTo` option](http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-appendTo), this plugin method is no longer necessary. If you are using `.zIndex()`, or building a widget that must stack, check out our [guide to create stacking elements with a `ui-front` class name and `appendTo` option](http://api.jqueryui.com/theming/stacking-elements/).

### Added .labels()

[(#12475)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12475) This release introduces a new jQuery plugin method. `.labels()` finds all label elements associated with the first selected element.

## Mouse

### Deprecate distance and delay options

[(#10615)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10615) Interactions should be instantaneous. These settings are typically used to prevent accidental drags, but a proper fix for that is to improve the UX, e.g., using handles to avoid accidental drags.

## Button

REWRITE WARNING PLACEHOLDER

button is still button, but doesn't support checkbox/radio anymore, only a single icon (with more flexible positioning), text option renamed to showLabel.

buttonset is now controlgroup, supports more than just button

brand new checkboxradio widget...

## Dialog

### Deprecated `dialogClass` in favor of `classes.ui-dialog`

[(#12161)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12161) The `dialogClass` option is now deprecated. Use the new `classes` option with the `"ui-dialog"` property instead.

Old:
```js
$( ".content" ).dialog( {
	dialogClass: "payment-dialog"
} );
```

New:
```js
$( ".content" ).dialog( {
	classes: {
		"ui-dialog": "payment-dialog"
	}
} );
```

## Droppable

### Deprecated `activeClass` in favor of `classes.ui-droppable-active`

[(#12162)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12162) The `activeClass` option is now deprecated. Use the new `classes` option with the `"ui-droppable-active"` property instead.

Old:
```js
$( ".target" ).droppable( {
	activeClass: "drop-target"
} );
```

New:
```js
$( ".target" ).droppable( {
	classes: {
		"ui-droppable-active": "drop-target"
	}
} );
```

### Deprecated `hoverClass` in favor of `classes.ui-droppable-hover`

[(#12162)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12162) The `hoverClass` option is now deprecated. Use the new `classes` option with the `"ui-droppable-hover"` property instead.

Old:
```js
$( ".target" ).droppable( {
	hoverClass: "drop-hover"
} );
```

New:
```js
$( ".target" ).droppable( {
	classes: {
		"ui-droppable-hover": "drop-hover"
	}
} );
```

### Removed `$.ui.intersect()`

[(#10534)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10534) Droppable used to define `$.ui.intersect()` which was only used in droppable itself and is not documented anywhere. We moved this method inside the closure, effectively removing it.

## Menu

### Require wrappers for each menu item

[(#10162)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10162) To resolve [several styling issues](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10162), the menu widget now requires each menu item to be wrapped with a DOM element. The example below uses `<div>` elements for wrappers, but you can use any block-level element.

Old:

```html
<ul id="menu">
	<li>One</li>
	<li>Two</li>
</ul>
```

New:

```html
<ul id="menu">
	<li>
		<div>One</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>Two</div>
	</li>
</ul>
```

The autocomplete and selectmenu widgets, which both use menu internally, were both updated to include wrappers.

<p clas="warning">This is a breaking change. If you use menu directly in your project, you need to update its markup to include the wrappers. Otherwise you'll end up with a menu that looks wrong and can't be interacted with.</p>

### Use consistent styling for focused and active items

[(#10692)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10692) We used to style active parent menu items with "ui-state-active", while everything else got "ui-state-focus" (or hover, which we style the same as focus). When a menu item in a submenu has focus, the parent menu item gets "ui-state-active", which is inconsistent and confusing. We've now switched to using only the "ui-state-active" class.

## Selectmenu

### Added `_renderButtonItem()` method

[(#10142)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10142) The [new extension method `._renderButtonItem()`](http://api.jqueryui.com/selectmenu/#method-_renderButtonItem) makes customizations of how the selected item is rendered a lot easier.

### Support `width: false` and default to 14em

[(#11198)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/11198) `width: null` still matches the width of the original element. `width: false` prevents an inline style from being set for the width. This makes it easy to set the width via a stylesheet and allows the use of any unit for setting the width, such as the new default of 14em.



## Tabs

### Deprecated `ui-tab` class, replaced with `ui-tabs-tab`

[(#12061)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12061) The tabs widget now adds the `ui-tabs-tab` class instead of the inconsistently named `ui-tab` to each tab element.

## Tooltip

### Deprecated `tooltipClass` in favor of `classes.ui-tooltip`

[(#12167)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/12167) The `tooltipClass` option is now deprecated. Use the new `classes` option with the `"ui-tooltip"` property instead.

Old:
```js
$( ".content" ).tooltip( {
	tooltipClass: "warning"
} );
```

New:
```js
$( ".content" ).tooltip( {
	classes: {
		"ui-tooltip": "warning"
	}
} );
```

### Allow DOM elements and jQuery objects as content

[(#9278)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9278) Tooltip now accepts HTMLElement and jQuery objects for the content option.

## Widget

### Ability to customize style-related CSS classes

[(#7053)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7053) jQuery UI used to hardcode classes like `.ui-corner-all` in widgets. We removed the hardcoding and added the ability to customize the style-related classes based on the functional classes. For the dialog, droppable and tooltip widgets, we replaced options that were doing just that.

Here's an example using dialog:
```js
$( "#dialog" ).dialog( {
	classes: {
		"ui-dialog": "ui-corner-top awesome-fade-class",
		"ui-dialog-titlebar": null
	}
} );
```

## Effects

### Make transfer effect a jQuery plugin method

The transfer effect was available through the extended `.show()`, `.hide()` and `.toggle()` methods, which was a side-effect of exposing it as an effect, but made no semantic sense. The effect is now available exclusively through the `.transfer()` method.

Old:
```js
$( ".from" ).effect( "transfer", {
	to: $( ".target" )
} );
```

New:
```js
$( ".from" ).transfer( {
	to: $( ".target" )
} );
```
