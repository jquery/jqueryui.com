## Overview

This guide will assist in upgrading from jQuery UI 1.11.x to jQuery UI 1.12.x. All changes are listed below, organized by plugin, along with how to upgrade your code to work with jQuery UI 1.12.

## General changes

Independent of changes to specific component, this release removes support for IE7, modernizes the theming and improves support for AMD.

### Removed IE7 workarounds

[(#9838)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9838) All IE7 workarounds have been removed from the source code. If need continued IE7 support you can continue to use jQuery UI 1.11.x.

### Font size changes

jQuery UI themes used to be built around a `body` font-size of 62.5%. This rather small font-size default is now gone, assuming instead the default font-size of browsers.

### New default theme

jQuery UI used to ship with a default theme called Smoothness. This theme is still available through ThemeRoller, but has been replaced by a new default theme called Base. This new theme has been modernized to get rid of background gradients, reduce rounded corners and use some colors outside of the greyscale range. In other words, it looks much better.

### AMD support

All source files in jQuery UI now contain UMD wrappers, making it easier to load these files through AMD loaders like requirejs. You no longer no to provide a `shim` property or equivalent for loading jQuery UI components.

## Button

REWRITE WARNING PLACEHOLDER

button is still button, but doesn't support checkbox/radio anymore, only a single icon (with more flexible positioning), text option renamed to showLabel.

buttonset is now controlgroup, supports more than just button

brand new checkboxradio widget...

## Dialog

The `dialogClass` option is now deprecated. Use the new `classes` option with the `"ui-dialog"` property instead.

Old:
```js
$( ".content" ).dialog( {
	dialogClass: "payment-dialog"
} );
```

New:
```js
$( ".content" ).dialog( {
	classes: {
		"ui-dialog": "payment-dialog"
	}
} );
```

## Droppable

The `activeClass` and `hoverClass` options are now deprecated. Use the new `classes` option with the `"ui-droppable-active"` and `"ui-droppable-hover"` properties instead.

Old:
```js
$( ".target" ).droppable( {
	activeClass: "drop-target",
	hoverClass: "drop-hover"
} );
```

New:
```js
$( ".target" ).droppable( {
	classes: {
		"ui-droppable-active": "drop-target",
		"ui-droppable-hover": "drop-hover"
	}
} );
```

## Menu

[(#10162)](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10162) To resolve [several styling issues](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10162), the menu widget now requires each menu item to be wrapped with a DOM element. The example below uses `<div>` elements for wrappers, but you can use any block-level element.

Old:

```html
<ul id="menu">
	<li>One</li>
	<li>Two</li>
</ul>
```

New:

```html
<ul id="menu">
	<li>
		<div>One</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div>Two</div>
	</li>
</ul>
```

The autocomplete and selectmenu widgets, which both use menu internally, were both updated to include wrappers.

<p clas="warning">This is a breaking change. If you use menu directly in your project, you need to update its markup to include the wrappers. Otherwise you'll end up with a menu that looks wrong and can't be interacted with.</p>

## Tooltip

The `tooltipClass` option is now deprecated. Use the new `classes` option with the `"ui-tooltip"` property instead.

Old:
```js
$( ".content" ).tooltip( {
	tooltipClass: "warning"
} );
```

New:
```js
$( ".content" ).tooltip( {
	classes: {
		"ui-tooltip": "warning"
	}
} );
```
