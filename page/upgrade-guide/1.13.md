}</script>

## Overview

This guide will assist in upgrading from jQuery UI 1.12.x to jQuery UI 1.13.x. All changes are listed below, organized by plugin, along with how to upgrade your code to work with jQuery UI 1.13.

## Reminder: API Redesigns

jQuery UI 1.12 introduced API redesigns for Button, Buttonset, Dialog, Draggable, Droppable, Menu, Mouse, Resizable, Selectable, Sortable, Tabs, Tooltip, and Effects. You can read about the API redesign process on the
[jQuery UI Blog](https://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/03/api-redesigns-the-past-present-and-future/). Although the redesigns introduced breaking changes, **1.12 & 1.13 maintains a lot of compatibility with the 1.11 API by default.** This is accomplished by rebuilding the 1.11 API on top of the 1.12/1.13 API. The default behavior for all 1.12 & 1.13 releases will be to simultaneously use the 1.11 and 1.12/1.13 APIs where possible. If you would like to load just the 1.12/1.13 API without the 1.11 API to prepare for jQuery UI 1.14, you can set the `$.uiBackCompat` flag to `false`.

```html
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script>$.uiBackCompat = false;</script>
<script src="jquery-ui.js"></script>
```

<p class="note">If you find a regression from the 1.11 API, please report it in the <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/new">bug tracker</a>. Even though the 1.11 API is deprecated, it's important for 1.13 releases not to regress so that users are encouraged to upgrade even if they're not ready to use the new APIs.</p>

## General changes

The main focus of this release was improving compatibility with recent jQuery versions. Removal of deprecated APIs and removal of legacy browser support are not included. Therefore, the number of breaking changes is extremely limited compared to previous upgrades.

### Security fixes

A few security fixes have landed in this release; they're marked with their assigned CVEs below.

### Strict mode

Both the compiled jQuery UI JavaScript files and all individual AMD modules now use ECMAScript 5 strict mode. This shouldn't be noticeable to most users; some older debugging tools may not be able to step through the code, though.

A similar change has been live in jQuery since version 3.0.0, so we're optimistic this will not cause issues for jQuery UI either.

### Files & directory structure

There have been some minor changes to source files:
* Source has been migrated from JSHint + JSCS to ESLint. The linter config files are no longer included in the `jquery-ui` npm package.
* The file `jquery-1-7.js` has been renamed to `ui/jquery-patch.js` since it includes patches for all jQuery versions from 1.8 to 3.4 inclusive.
* The jQuery Color library is no longer inlined into the `ui/effects.js` module; instead, it lies in `ui/vendor/jquery-color/jquery-color.js` and `ui/effects.js` declares an AMD dependency on the file.
* The file `ui/escape-selector.js` has been removed.

### Newer Core features

As part of making sure jQuery UI doesn't depend on deprecated Core APIs, we started using some newer Core APIs, polyfilling them in the `jquery-patch.js` file for older jQuery versions. If you haven't included `jquery-1-7.js` in your bundle of jQuery UI 1.12.x, you may still need to include `jquery-patch.js` when migrating to UI 1.13.x; it's required for all jQuery versions older than 3.5.0.

### Dropped support for jQuery 1.7

([gh-1923](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1923), [b61b16b](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/b61b16b5a89ee27b30efdf7635d897af810af130)) jQuery UI no longer supports jQuery 1.7. The minimal supported version is now 1.8.0.

### Dropped `$.ui.escapeSelector`

The private `$.ui.escapeSelector` API has been dropped in favor of a jQuery `$.escapeSelector` one. That API is only available in jQuery 3.0.0 & newer but jQuery UI polyfills it via `ui/jquery-patch.js` for older jQuery versions.

## Accordion

### Added function value for a `header` option

([gh-1904](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1904), [0c860b0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/0c860b0d92f9959f6747f8c02e9671eb2fc561aa)) Accordion’s [`header` option](https://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-header) may now accept not only a selector matching header elements:
```js
$( ".selector" ).accordion( {
  header: "h3"
} );
```
but also a function taking the accordion element as a parameter and returning the header elements:
```js
$( ".selector" ).accordion( {
  header: function ( accordionElement ) {
    return accordionElement.find( "h3" );
  }
} );
```

## Datepicker

### Added `onUpdateDatepicker` callback

([gh-1912](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1912), [17d115b](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/17d115b8298b935ab0d26b881d4f6f3e83984868), [a12c985](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/a12c98574d07f002fd59d166f9fc1fd391581b91)) Datepicker options now include the optional [`onUpdateDatepicker` callback](https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-onUpdateDatepicker), called when the datepicker widget’s DOM is updated.

### `altField` no longer accepts HTML input

([CVE-2021-41182](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-9gj3-hwp5-pmwc), [gh-1954](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1954), [3285086](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/32850869d308d5e7c9bf3e3b4d483ea886d373ce)) Due to a bug, the [`altField` option](https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-altField) used to accept HTML input that created fresh elements. This is now fixed and all string input is treated as a CSS selector.

### Various `*Text` options no longer accept HTML input

([CVE-2021-41183](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-j7qv-pgf6-hvh4), [trac-15284](https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/15284), [gh-1953](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1953), [afe20b7](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/afe20b79a64266e64011f34b26a30b3d1c62fd47)) Various [Datepicker](https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/) `*Text` options: [`appendText`](https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-appendText), [`buttonText`](https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-buttonText), [`closeText`](https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-closeText), [`currentText`](https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-currentText), [`nextText`](https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-nextText) and [`prevText`](https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-prevText) used to erroneously accept HTML input despite never documented to do so. That disconnect between docs & reality can lead to security issues so the options now only accept text input.

## Position

### `of` is treated as a CSS selector

([CVE-2021-41184](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-gpqq-952q-5327), [gh-1955](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1955), [effa323](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/effa323f1505f2ce7a324e4f429fa9032c72f280)) Due to a bug, the [`of` option](https://api.jqueryui.com/position/#position-options-options) used to accept HTML input that created fresh elements. This is now fixed and all string input is treated as a CSS selector.
