	"title": "jQuery UI 1.10 Upgrade Guide",
	"toc": true
}</script>

## Overview

This guide will assist in upgrading from jQuery UI 1.9.x to jQuery UI 1.10.x.
All changes are listed below, organized by plugin, along with how to upgrade
your code to work with jQuery UI 1.10.

## API Redesigns

jQuery UI 1.10 introduces API redesigns for Dialog and Progressbar.
You can read about the API redesign process on the
[jQuery UI Blog](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/03/api-redesigns-the-past-present-and-future/).
Although the redesigns introduce breaking changes,
**1.10 maintains full compatibility with the 1.9 API by default.**
This is accomplished by rebuilding the 1.9 API on top of the 1.10 API. The
default behavior for all 1.10 releases will be to simultaneously use the 1.9
and 1.10 APIs, deferring to the 1.9 API if there is a conflict. If you would like
to load just the 1.10 API without the 1.9 API, you can set the `$.uiBackCompat`
flag to `false`.

```html
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script>$.uiBackCompat = false;</script>
<script src="jquery-ui.js"></script>
```

This will prevent the initialization of the back-compat layer, allowing you to
use the 1.10 API in cases where there is a conflict with the 1.9 API.

### Preparing for jQuery UI 1.11

The API redesigns deprecate some functionality, which will be removed in 1.11.
You don't have to wait for the 1.11.0 release in order to find out if your code
will work when the 1.9 APIs are removed. You can use the `$.uiBackCompat` flag
to test this with any 1.10 release.

**If you find a regression from the 1.9 API, please report it in the
[bug tracker](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/newticket). Even though the 1.9 API is
deprecated, it's important for 1.10 releases not to regress so that users are
encouraged to upgrade even if they're not ready to use the new APIs. Note that
most 1.8 APIs which were deprecated in 1.9 were removed in 1.10 and will not
exist, regardless of the `$.uiBackCompat` flag.**

### Removed support for IE6

IE6 usage has dropped to a low enough point that jQuery UI no longer finds it
necessary to support. As of 1.10.0, some portions of jQuery UI may not work
properly in IE6. If you need to continue to support IE6, use the latest
jQuery UI 1.9 release.

### Improved download builder

The download builder once again supports downloading two versions. You can now
download the latest stable release and one major version back. Also, as a result of
[GitHub removing support for uploads](https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads),
we now host the download zips for all versions at http://jqueryui.com/download/all/.



## Core

### Removed `$.ui.isOver()` and `$.ui.isOverAxis()` methods

([#8891](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8891))
The `$.ui.isOver()` and `$.ui.isOverAxis()` methods were written for specific
plugins and had less-than-obvious APIs. They have been deprecated for a while,
and as such have been removed.

### Removed `$.ui.contains()` method; use `$.contains()`

([#8902](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8902))
The `$.ui.contains()` method has been removed in favor of `$.contains()`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-ui-contains) for full details.



## Accordion

### Added ability to add/remove panels

([#4672](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4672))
The `refresh` method will now recognize panels that have been added or removed.
This brings accordion in line with tabs and other widgets that parse the markup
to find changes.

```
// Initialize the accordion
$( "#accordion" ).accordion();

// Add a new header and panel
$( "<h3>New Panel</h3>" ).appendTo( "#accordion" );
$( "<div>jQuery UI sure is awesome!</div>" ).appendTo( "#accordion" );

// Refresh the accordion
$( "#accordion" ).accordion( "refresh" );
```

### Removed `changestart` event; use `beforeActivate`

([#6841](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6841))
The `changestart` event has been removed in favor of `beforeActivate`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-changestart-event-renamed-to-beforeactivate) for full details.

### Removed `change` event; use `activate`

([#6843](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6843))
The `change` event has been removed in favor of `activate`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-change-event-renamed-to-activate) for full details.

### Removed `resize` method; use `refresh`

([#6839](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6839))
The `resize` method has been removed in favor of `refresh`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-resize-method-renamed-to-refresh) for full details.

### Removed `animated` option; use `animate`

([#8601](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8601))
The `animated` option has been removed in favor of `animate`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-animated-option-renamed-to-animate) for full details.

### Removed `icons.headerSelected` option; use `icons.activeHeader`

([#6835](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6835))
The `icons.headerSelected` option has been removed in favor of `icons.activeHeader`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-icons-headerselected-option-renamed-to-icons-activeheader) for full details.

### Removed `autoHeight`, `clearStyle`, and `fillSpace` options; use `heightStyle`

([#5868](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5868))
([#5872](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5872))
The `autoHeight`, `clearStyle`, and `fillSpace` options have been removed in favor of `heightStyle`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-autoheight-clearstyle-and-fillspace-options-merged-into-heightstyle) for full details.

### Removed `activate` method; use `active` option

([#6837](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6837))
The `activate` method has been removed in favor of the `active` option.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-activate-method) for full details.

### Removed `navigation` and `navigationFilter` options

([#5870](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5870))
The `navigation` and `navigationFilter` options have been removed.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-navigation-and-navigationfilter-options) for full details.

### Removed support for non-number/falsey values for `active` option

([#6853](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6853))
The `active` option must be set to a number, or `false` to collapse. Negative numbers will now select panels starting from the last panel, similar to `.eq()`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-support-for-activating-panels-with-selectors-or-collapsing-with-1) for full details.



## Autocomplete

### Removed `item.autocomplete` data; use `ui-autocomplete-item`

([#8156](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8156))
Each menu item stores its source object using `.data()`. This data is no longer
stored with a key of `item.autocomplete`, but rather `ui-autocomplete-item`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#changed-naming-convention-for-data-keys) for full details.



## Dialog

### Added `appendTo` option

([#7948](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7948))
Previously, dialogs had always been appended to the body to ensure they were
the last element in the DOM to avoid conflicts with other stacking contexts.
However, in order to allow more flexibility and simplify the stacking logic,
an `appendTo` option has been added which defaults to the body. Check out the
[API documentation](http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-appendTo) for more
information.

### Added ability to specify which element to focus on open

([#4731](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4731))
When a dialog opens, it gains focus so that the user may immediately start
interacting with it. This also allows assistive technologies, such as screen
readers, to announce the dialog. The logic for which element gains focus has
traditionally been whichever element is found first in the following categories:
tabbable elements within the content area, tabbable elements within the button
pane, the close button, and finally the dialog itself as a fallback. Starting
with 1.10.0, if there is an element inside the content area with the `autofocus`
attribute, that element will gain focus; if there is none, then the previous
logic will be used.

### Added support for icons in buttons

([#6830](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6830))
The `buttons` option now supports two more properties to control the use of icons.
An `icons` hash may be provided, with `primary` and/or `secondary` properties,
and the `showText` property may be set to false to hide text when using an icon.
For more information on using icons, see the
[button documentation](http://api.jqueryui.com/button/#option-icons).

### Restore focus on close

([#8730](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8730))
In addition to having more control over which element gains focus when the dialog
opens, the dialog will also remember which element had focus outside of the dialog.
When the dialog is closed, focus will be restored to the element that had focus
immediately before the dialog opened. This will put the user back in the same
state they were in, again resulting in improved usability and accessibility.

### Deprecated array and string notations for `position` option

([#8824](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8824))
Over time, the dialog widget accrued a few different ways to specify the opening
position. You could specify a string, such as "left center"; or an array of pixels,
such as `[ 200, 100 ]`; or an object that would get passed to the
[position utility](http://api.jqueryui.com/position/). Since we have standardized
on using the position utility in all widgets, we have deprecated the string and
array notations.

Old API:

```js
$( "#dialog" ).dialog({
	position: "right bottom"
});
```

New API:

```js
$( "#dialog" ).dialog({
	position: {
		my: "right bottom",
		at: "right bottom"
	}
});
```

Old API:

```js
$( "#dialog" ).dialog({
	position: [ 200, 100 ]
});
```

New API:

```js
$( "#dialog" ).dialog({
	position: {
		my: "left top",
		at: "left+200 top+100"
	}
});
```

### Removed `stack` option

([#8722](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8722))
Dialogs previously supported a `stack` option, which determined whether dialogs
should move to the top when focused. As this should always be the case, the
opiton has been removed.

### Removed `zIndex` option

([#8729](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8729))
Similar to the `stack` option, the `zIndex` option is unnecessary with a proper
stacking implementation. The z-index is defined in CSS and stacking is now
controlled by ensuring the focused dialog is the last "stacking" element in its
parent.

### Changed `title` option from HTML to text

([#6016](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6016))
Dialog titles are controlled either via the `title` option or the `title`
attribute on the content element. The title has previously been set as HTML,
but since titles are generally plain text, this could easily cause a scripting
vulnerability for users who don't realize the value is being set as HTML. As a
result, titles are now set as text. If you need to add custom formatting to your
dialog titles, you can override the `_title()` method on the dialog.



## Position

### Removed `offset` option; use `my` or `at`

([#6982](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6982))
The `offset` option has been removed in favor of providing offset information in
`my` or `at`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-offset-option-merged-into-my-and-at) for full details.



## Progressbar

### Added support for indeterminate progressbars

([#7624](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7624))
The progressbar widget now supports an indeterminate state for situations where
the current status of an action cannot be determined. Simply set the `value`
option to `false` to create an indeterminate progressbar. You can seamlessly
transition from an indeterminate progressbar to a determinate progressbar just
by changing the `value` from `false` to a number.



## Resizable

### Added support for complex markup in handles

([#8756](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8756))
While most users let the resizable widget generate handles automatically, it is
possible to create your own handles in the markup prior to initialization.
However, until now the handles were required to be a single element. As of 1.10.0,
custom handles can contain complex markup, nesting elements as deep as you wish
within the handle.



## Spinner

### Trigger all events for programmatic steps

([#8901](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8901))
In 1.9.x, the spinner widget did not trigger `start`, `spin`, or `stop` events
when programmatically stepping via the `stepUp()`, `stepDown()`, `pageUp()`, or
`pageDown()` methods (only `change` was triggered). Starting with 1.10.0, all
events are triggered, maching the behavior of a user-initiated step.



## Tabs

### Removed `fx` option; use `show` and `hide`

([#8320](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8320))
The `fx` option has been removed in favor of `show` and `hide`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-fx-option-use-show-and-hide-options) for full details.

### Removed `ajaxOptions` and `cache` options; use `beforeLoad` event

([#7147](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7147))

`beforeLoad` event.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-ajaxoptions-and-cache-options-added-beforeload-event) for full details.

### Removed `url` method; use `aria-controls` attribute

([#7148](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7148))
The `url` method has been removed in favor of the `aria-controls` attribute.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-url-method-and-use-of-title-attribute-use-aria-controls-attribute) for full details.

### Removed use of `title` attribute; use `aria-controls`

([#7149](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7149))
Use of the `title` attribute to specify a tab panel has been removed in favor of
`aria-controls`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-url-method-and-use-of-title-attribute-use-aria-controls-attribute) for full details.

### Removed `abort` method

([#7150](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7150))
The `abort` method was removed in favor of storing a reference to the `jqXHR`
object in the `beforeLoad` event.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-abort-method) for full details.

### Removed `spinner` option

([#7151](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7151))
The `spinner` options has been removed.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-spinner-option) for full details.

See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-select-method) for full details.

### Removed `add` and `remove` methods; use `refresh`

([#7158](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7158))
The `add` and `remove` methods have been removed in favor of `refresh`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-add-and-remove-methods-and-events-use-refresh-method) for full details.

The `load` event now passes jQuery objects instead of DOM elements for consistency
with other plugins in jQuery UI.

Old API:

```js
$( "#tabs" ).tabs({
	load: function( event, ui ) {
		$( ui.panel ).addClass( "loaded" );
	}
});
```

New API:

```js

([#7192](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7192))
Use of the metadata plugin for widget options has been removed.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-use-of-metadata-plugin) for full details.

### Removed `widgetBaseClass` property; use `widgetFullName`

([#8155](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8155))
The `widgetBaseClass` property has been removed in favor of `widgetFullName`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-widgetbaseclass-property-renamed-to-widgetfullname) for full details.

### Removed data fallbacks for widget names

([#8801](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8801))
Widgets used to store their instances in `.data()` using just the plugin name as
a key. The instances are now stored using the widget namespace as well. For
example, the dialog widget is now stored in `ui-dialog` instead of `dialog`.
See [the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#changed-naming-convention-for-data-keys) for full details.



## Effects

### Removed support for effects in `$.effects[]`; use `$.effects.effect[]`

([#7115](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7115))
Support for defining effects directly on `$.effects` has been removed in favor
of defining effects on `$.effects.effect`. The API for new effects is slightly
different, so make sure to read
[the 1.9 deprecation notice](http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#redesigned-effects-api) for full details.
