All changes are listed below, organized by plugin, along with how to upgrade
your code to work with jQuery UI 1.8.11.

## Autocomplete

### Added `autoFocus` option

([#7032](https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7032))
A new option has been added to automatically focus the first item in the search
results. This reduces the number of key presses needed to select an item from
the list and makes selecting the first result as easy as tabbing away from the
field once the menu is displayed. This option is off by default, to turn it on,
simply set the `autoFocus` option to `true`.

```js
$( "#autocomplete" ).autocomplete({
	source: [ "hello", "world" ],
	autoFocus: true
});
```
