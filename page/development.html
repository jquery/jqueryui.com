<h2>Development Status</h2>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://wiki.jqueryui.com/Roadmap">
Roadmap</a> to find out what we're working on.</p>

<p>We're also working on our new sites. All of our sites are on GitHub, with the
repositories named after the respective domain. For example, the repository for
this site is <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com">jquery/jqueryui.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>

<p>Before filing a bug report, there are a few simple steps you should follow.
First, <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/issues">search for existing
tickets</a> to see if the issue has already been reported. Try a few different
phrases in case someone else described the problem in a slightly different way.
If you don't find an existing ticket, then
<a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/new">create a new ticket</a>. Make sure
to provide a clear explanation of the problem, along with a reduced test case
created in <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a> or
<a href="https://jsbin.com/">jsbin</a> using the latest version of jQuery UI.</p>
