<h2>Development Status</h2>

<p>The current stable release is 1.10.4. Check out our <a href="http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Roadmap">

<h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>

<p>Before filing a bug report, there are a few simple steps you should follow.
First, <a href="http://bugs.jqueryui.com/search?ticket=on">search for existing
tickets</a> to see if the issue has already been reported. Try a few different
phrases in case someone else described the problem in a slightly different way.
If you don't find an existing ticket, then
<a href="http://bugs.jqueryui.com/newticket/">create a new ticket</a>. Make sure
to provide a clear explanation of the problem, along with a reduced test case
created in <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a> or
<a href="http://jsbin.com/">jsbin</a> using the latest version of jQuery UI.</p>
