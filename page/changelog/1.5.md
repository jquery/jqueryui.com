### Sortable

* Rich interconnectivity
    * Connect multiple sortables and allow sorting two-way or one-way
    * Serialize sorting results to a url string or to arrays
* Drag draggables into sortable lists, drop sortable items on droppables
* Improved tolerance
    * Three tolerance modes: "intersect", "pointer" and "guess", defaults to "guess"
    * Now works for all kinds of different sized elements
* Adds much of the draggable functionality: cursor, zIndex, revert, opacity, axis, handles, containment and scrolling
* Introduces more callbacks: over/out, activate/deactivate and remove/receive
* Better control the placeholder: insert object with element and update callbacks to do what you want

### Tabs

* all things zero-based for consistency
* show callback is now called on initialization
* set selected tab via selected option
* set all tabs unselected via selected: null instead of another redundant option
* simplified effects options - one fx option (which mirrors jQueryâ€™s default animate options) instead of a bunch of others to remember.
